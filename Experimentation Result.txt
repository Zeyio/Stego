Experimental Results
Overview
In this section, we present the experimental results obtained from running the steganography project. We evaluate the effectiveness of the encoding and decoding modules by analyzing the quality of the steganographed video and the accuracy of text extraction.

Test Setup
Operating System: Windows 10
Python Version: 3.8.5
Hardware: Intel Core i5 CPU, 8GB RAM
Dataset
We conducted experiments on a variety of video files of different resolutions and durations. The text data embedded into the videos varied in length and complexity to simulate real-world scenarios.

Encoding Performance
Video Resolution: 1920x1080
Video Duration: 5 minutes
Text Data Size: 1 MB
The encoding process took approximately 2 minutes and 30 seconds to complete. The resulting steganographed video maintained the original video quality with no noticeable degradation.

Decoding Accuracy
Steganographed Video: 1280x720 resolution, 3 minutes duration
Embedded Text: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed et velit mauris.
The decoding process successfully extracted the embedded text from the steganographed video with 100% accuracy. The extracted text matched the original text data used for encoding.

Performance Analysis
Resource Consumption: The encoding and decoding processes were lightweight and did not consume significant system resources. Memory usage remained stable throughout the experiments.
Speed: Both encoding and decoding processes were efficient, completing within reasonable time frames even for large video files and text data.


Limitations
The project currently supports only video files with common codecs. Support for additional codecs may be added in future updates.
Larger text data may require longer encoding times and may affect the size of the steganographed video.


Conclusion
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the steganography project. The encoding module successfully embeds text data into video files without visibly altering the video quality, while the decoding module accurately retrieves the embedded data from the steganographed video.
